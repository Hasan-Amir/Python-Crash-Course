"""5-10. Checking Usernames: Do the following to create a program that
simulates how websites ensure that everyone has a unique username.
Make a list of five or more usernames called current_users.
Make another list of five usernames called new_users. Make sure one or
two of the new usernames are also in the current_users list.
Loop through the new_users list to see if each new username has already
been used. If it has, print a message that the person will need to enter a
new username. If a username has not been used, print a message saying
that the username is available.
Make sure your comparison is case insensitive. If 'John' has been used,
'JOHN' should not be accepted. (To do this, youâ€™ll need to make a copy of
current_users containing the lowercase versions of all existing users.)"""
